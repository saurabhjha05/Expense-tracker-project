-> Expense tracker is a project in which a user can add daily expense which will be stored categorically in an excel sheet (csv file) 
   There are mainly five category (food , clothes , grocery , bills & dues and miscellaneous expenses)
   In This user can add expense done and also give brief description of the expense which will also be stored in the file

-> User can also view summary of total expenditure done and also category wise summary of expense 
   I will soon add graphs to show and analyse expenditure
